A Java web-app that makes based64 enconded Json comparisons.


### Description:

- Provides two http endpoints that accept JSON base64 encoded binary data on both endpoints:
  - <host>/v1/diff/<ID>/left
  - <host>/v1/diff/<ID>/right
- Provided data are diff-ed and results are available on the third endpoint:
  - <host>/v1/diff/<ID>
- Results provide the following information in JSON format:
  - Data are equal,
  - Data have the same size but have differeces, and
  - Data differ on size.


## How to start the server

Clone the [repository](https://github.com/marquicodes/data-diff.git) into a directory.

```sh
$ cd data-diff
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```

## In-memory database (H2)

Application uses an in-memory database to persist the uploaded data. Each time server stops, data stored into this database is getting lost.

If you want to take a look of the database, you are free to navigate to [http://localhost:8080/h2](http://localhost:8080/h2) and fill-in the following info.

```sh
Driver Class: org.h2.Driver
JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:diff-db
User Name: sa
Password: <leave it blank>
```


## How to run tests

To run the tests using Maven type the command:

```sh
$ cd data-diff
$ mvn test
```
